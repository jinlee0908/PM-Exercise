#### STAND UP 
Team will conduct daily stand up with exception of Sprint planning day.
  	
Protocol: Team members share: What was done yesterday, what is planned for today, and any blockers.

#### SPRINT: Development team will work on a 2 week sprint cadance starting on Wednesday and ending on Tuesday
Protocol: Stories are worked upon based on the assignee. 

As an assignee picks up a issue/story to work on, the assignee will move the ticket from 'Backlog' to 'In Progress' to 'QA'.

As the ticket is worked, the assignee will comment on the issue/story each day to mark progress and reminder of where the ticket has been left off.

Someone else on the team will conduct 'QA/Review' upon a ticket has moved to 'QA/Review' - ticket will be reassigned to the reviewer.

Once a ticket has been moved to Product Review, the ticket will be resigned to the Product Manager.

When a ticket has passed Product Review, the ticket can be moved to 'Done'. 

Outcome: High quality output that is completed as outlined by Product Manager.
	
#### GROOMING: Grooming sessions will be the first Tuesday of the sprint
Protocol: Prepared stories will be reviewed by the development or design team for feedback, questions on the story (issue) and size the effort.

Outcome: Completed Issues where all questions are answered, and the story is complete with sizing or pointing effort will be moved to backlog.
     
#### SPRINT PLANNING: Planning session will be on the last day of the Sprint
Protocol: Only stories in backlog already reviewed, sized/pointed, and deemed ready for development can be pulled into the sprint.
